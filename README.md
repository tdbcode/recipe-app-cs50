#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqQ1WIBf5YE&ab_channel=ThomasBrady
#### Description:

My CS50 final project - I used ReactJS and EdamamAPI to build a basic Recipe Search algorithm with multiple forms of criteria.

I decided to go with a ReactJS project for my final project as it is in a skill area I wanted to develop and relevant for the area of industry I am interested in career switching to.

This project actually took numerous attempts as intially I couldn't decided whether to attempt a forum app or a search style app. I settled on this idea when I discovered the following links during the research phase and found out about Edamam API (also another skill I wanted to develop - that being understanding APIs further).
